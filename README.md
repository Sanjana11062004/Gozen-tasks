Below listed are the concepts implemeneted in this project.
1. Basic Component Creation: In React, components are the building blocks of your UI. They are reusable and encapsulate both structure and behaviour. You can create components using either function components or class components.

2. State Management: State management involves managing the data that changes over time within a React application.

3. Conditional Rendering: Conditional rendering refers to showing or hiding components or elements based on certain conditions. This is often done using JavaScript expressions within JSX to conditionally render components.

4. Forms and Controlled Components: In React, forms are typically managed using controlled components. This means that form elements like inputs, textareas, and selects maintain their own state in the component's state and update it via event handlers.

5. Component Composition (Higher Order Component): Component composition involves combining smaller, reusable components to build larger components. Higher Order Components (HOCs) are a pattern in React for reusing component logic, where a function takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionality.

6. Lifecycle Methods or useEffect Hook: Lifecycle methods (for class components) and the useEffect hook (for function components) allow you to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as when it mounts, updates, or unmounts.

7. Routing with React Router: React Router is a popular library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and map them to specific components to be rendered when certain URLs are accessed.

8. Error Boundary Implementation: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire component tree. They help to isolate errors and prevent them from affecting the rest of the application.

9. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading: Code splitting is a technique used to split your code into smaller chunks and load them on-demand, rather than all at once. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing initial load times. Lazy loading refers to loading components or resources asynchronously, typically when they are needed.

10. Optimistic UI Updates: Optimistic UI updates involve updating the UI optimistically before receiving confirmation from the server. This can provide a smoother user experience by making the UI feel responsive even if the actual server update takes some time. If the server request fails, the UI can be reverted to its previous state.
